Servers Aren't Scary

Use Vercel, Heroku, DigitialOcean! That's the advice of modern day web devlopment gurus, most of which are sponsored by one cloud platform or the other. Do you really need to host your first app for $30/month?

Most modern web development courses and tutorial will have you sign up for a cloud hosting provider to build and deploy your first full stack app on. I'm here to tell you that this advice is crap.

a very fancy ui, some security, convenience, then charge you $30 a month. That single click deploy convinience of your MERN TODO app is now a Klarna loan for eternity signed in the blood and sweat it took you
