A Moral Framework

# description
A philosophy for surviving an uncaring universe.

I wish to design and build a moral framework, based on a scientific understanding of the universe, to help humans understand and survive an uncaring universe. Something that will appeal to and help people from all walks of life, and seek to build a better world through collaboration, rather than division. The modern world lacks a source of shared morality that religion has provided for much of human history, the rise of the scientific academic has created new agnostic and spiritual belivers. This contemporary and fast growing group is in direct sociological competition with traditional faith followers, this leads to divisive rehtoric and polarization. I belive this can be rectified by creating a shared framework of moral abstractions. One that etches the moral philosophies of the world in stone, while creating a shared understanding of morality that includes all relgions and creeds. A concise outline that analyzes and incorporates lessons, stories, morals, and ideologies from all religions, creating a relatable framework for followers of diverse faiths and worldviews to find common ground in human survival and morality.

# Introduction and Short-Hand Guide
There are two gods in the mind of all humans: The morally agnostic god of the universe, and our idealized personal god of the mind.

The agnostic god is simply the state of the universe, indifferent to our wants, needs, and desires. Our personal god is a framework of morals and beliefs about the universe that helps us physically and mentally survive the agnostic and ambivalent wrath of the agnostic god—the universe.

Therefore, god and religion are not contextually wrong as observed from the perspective of an individual follower of them. While the agnostic god exists, it is viewed and filtered through the lens of one's personal god. That personal god can be science, religion, ignorance, or this belief and moral framework in and of itself.

Science, like religion, tries to understand the state of the world. It does so in an analytical, self-explanatory, self-justifiable way: science is provable and repeatable. But science itself is still a filter through which we view the agnostic universe. It's a set of morals, tools, and beliefs that help us survive an uncaring god. Religion is also a filter compiled of morals, tools, and beliefs that help us survive. But in contrast to science, it is built on stories, practices, divine justice, and moral narratives.

Both create a personal god that appeals to the human context and perspective when it comes to survival and well-being. Let's take a basic example: murder. The universe, the uncaring god, does not care if you take a life. It will not administer consequences for the act. The act of murder is an inherent threat to the human experience. Therefore, a personal god would create a human-scoped moral that murder is bad and thus, should be prevented. Let's use this moral to see how science and religion compare:

- Murder in religion: Almost always universally a sin, an act to be avoided. A moral construct to prevent harm to the self, emotional, physical, and protective. Language and idea frameworks, "protect God's children," "God created all His children equally," are used to filter the morally agnostic care for murder the universe embodies, into a more human contextual perspective that benefits us and our survival.

- Murder in science: While not framed in terms of sin, soul, or spiritually based, a purely scientific approach does create a moral framework: It causes measurable psychological distress in close friends or relatives. It causes stress and harm to the social network of the deceased. Murder measurably ends someone's existence and consciousness. All are scientifically provable to be detrimental to the human context and perspective.

While it can be argued that science explains the root of religious belief as being a method for surviving an abstract morally agnostic universe, science itself acts exactly the same in its effect on the human context: A filter that applies our human needs, wants, and desires to an uncaring agnostic universe.

Religion and science exist as true gods to whoever their believers are because they are all valid to that person's individual human context. This idea gives me moral clarity about the world and the way people operate in it. It is the construct that my own moral beliefs and tools are built on. I created this science based moral god to guide me through curing my own suffering, as well as preventing and alleviating the suffering others face.

While the above glosses over many details and foundations, that's the point. The purpose of this is to lay out a science-based moral framework that can be abstracted and simplified, much like the way that high school students are taught in progression about the complexity of the atom, ranging from simple orbital diagrams to more complex probability clouds of electrons. Science can help us understand the core functioning of the unforgiving universe, while we build on it a moral framework that can help society and human beings thrive. Scientists are not philosophers; their goal is to understand the universe, not create a system of morals on top of it. And because of that, it can come across as if scientists themselves are challenging religion. This is not socially productive, as it builds divisiveness, anger, and hate on both sides. The result is scientists hating religion, and religious followers hating science. This framework can bridge that communication gap, prevent divisive spirals, and construct a system of cooperation.

# Selfishness to cooperation; how morals arise.
## Humans are selfish
Humans are inherently selfish. This is a basic human trait ingrained in our evolution, neccissary for survival. Many of the conflicts in our modern societies stem from this core trait. Selfishness is not inherently bad; it is an agnostic behavior, a tool that can be used for creative or destructive purposes, much like a knife. This is the fundamental basis of this moral framework. Life gives us tools, and it is up to use to create a self re-inforcing framework that promots constructive use of those tools. This is essential not just for the feels, self rigchousness, moral superiority, but for survival of the individual and group.

## Cooperation built on selfishness
So if selfishness is the root of all human motivation, why cooperate with others? The truth, and problem, about morality is that it is not inherent in an individual, it is learned. Morality emerges when selfish individuals realize that their well-being depends on the well-being of others — and act accordingly. Morality is a preference of decisions made in relation to other individuals. Is it moral to crush a rock? That question is silly and makes no sense to be asked, it's agnostic weather the rock get's crushed. The question only becomes moral when another individual, or a personhood, is introduced: "Is it moral to crush Owens rock?" That question implies a moral chioce, a struggle between two individuals. And therfor, morals are an emergent property of cooperation, of multiple indidivuals interacting, of a group, a society.

## Morals built on cooperation
Morals cannot exist without a group of selfish individuals operating in there own self interest, realizing that cooperation is benficial to themselves. That statement is hard to digest. Is all cooperation inheretnly selfish? We hear that and assume selfishness = bad. When the truth is that selfishness is the basis of all morals and cooperative behaviour. We cannot have cooperation without selfish motiviation. Therfor, selfish motivations are not inherently morally bad, they are a neutral tool, one that cooperation of multiple individuals is built upon.

## Pure selfishness
There is a distinction between moral and immoral selfishness we can now outline. Some forms of selfishness are benificial to the individual, but harmful to the group or others. These selfish acts result in a temporary, unsustainable, and socially consequential gain to the individual. They are purely selfishly motivated, gain at the expense of others. Examples of this type of selfish behaviour include lying, cheating, monopolies, pollution, overconsumption, destruction of commons. All of which result in short term gain for the individual. However, much like the tragedy of the commons itself, the long term end result to the individual is always worse off. From this we can learn: Pure selfishness is like giving into itching a mosquito bite, itching will releave the discomfort immediately. But will also release more histamines, the proteen your body uses to cause swelling, itching, and react to allergens, causing the bit to itch more and become more uncomfrotable. The end result: Temporary gain at the cost of long term detrminent.

## Resisting Pure Selfishness
But then how can we resist the pull of short term gain, short term selfishenss, and strive for long term cooperation? Why does long term cooperation have more resistance then short term back stabbing selfish behaviour?

The purpose of this framework is thus laid out: A moral framework, a system of belief, that can unify all humans in our common goal to selfishlessly survive. A proposition that if we truly cooperate, and acknowledge our common shared interest, that we can create together a better world, a better personal selfish experience together, for the individual, than any individual could on their own.

The beuaty in of morals that arise in cooperation is emergent from selfishness.

The solution to this, is creating a moral framework that humans can use to adjust their behaviour to. God is a perfect human to idolize and strive to be more alike in relgions, they look up to and worship a figure, in philosophy, a true idolizaiton

Why does short-term selfishness so often win out over long-term cooperation?

Because the rewards are immediate, and the consequences are delayed. This is a flaw in our evolved psychology. The mosquito bite itches now. Evolution never promised wisdom — just survival.

This is where moral frameworks, education, and collective understanding come in. We must teach and reinforce a new kind of selfishness — one that sees long-term cooperation as the highest form of self-preservation. We must create a Platonic ideal, a moral framework of an ideal society that is based on the fundamental understanding that we are all selfishly trying to survive, and instill within us the understanding that that survival

Note: Next, discuss where selfishness fails, and why a moral framework, education and understanding is needed to combat it.


# Ongoing Notes/ideas:
This section is just an ongoing list of ideas and info dumping, not a finished section intended to be read:

How is selfishness a force for good? How can it be used? How do groups utilize individual selfish behavior to promote individual survival and thus group survival? What are the limits of selfishness, and how can selfishness also be bad both for individuals and others? How can those limits be avoided and prevented with this framework?


s moral and spiritual crisis in yoyung people in the west

The western rise in spiritually and the crisis many people have in their faiths. This can be harnessed and used if given a clear moral understanding of the human context, a base for morality built on our best fundamental understanding of the universe.

Science has created an amazing understanding of the universe over the past 250 years. Thinkers and philosophers have failed to see the oportunity this has presented humanity in creating a new shared religion. An idea echoed in the book "The Ministry for The Future."


Donald from INVINCIBLE Season 2 Episode 7 25:44: We're not our bodies, we're the decisions we make, the lives we change, the people we love. Or who love us. I don't need to forget that, and neither do you.


Need to rewrite and work some of the wording around presenting science and religion in the same light, they should be "interpretive frameworks" that help people interpret the agnostic god/universe. This can help avoid the issue with people associating science with religion, even though they function the same way in the subjective sense.

People coming froma scientific or religious background will staunchly defend their opposition to the other side, scientific backgrounds will view religeon as immoral on the basis that it is not a provably true system that is based on empirical evidence and peer review and debate. Religion will see science as a system of academea, pompus, wrong at times, and structurally biased towards those in power.
