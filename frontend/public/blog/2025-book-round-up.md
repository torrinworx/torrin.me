2025 Book Round Up

# description
My 2025 book round up where I review the books that I have read this year. The good the great! and the aweful...

# The best!

2025 I tried to read as many genres as possible, it led me to discover I really love historical biographies, sci-fi mysteries, and deep emotional plots.

Here are the best books I've read this year:

### **We Are Legion (We Are Bob) by Dennis E. Taylor**

I picked this book up at Indego because of the new fancy hardcover. The word "BOB" powder printed on the sides of the pages caught my eye, as well as the beautiful illustration on the first and last pages.

This book was so much fun to read. Bob, an entraprenure, sign's up for a corpse freezing service that will cryo-freeze his body upon his death with the goal of reviving it when there is a cure for whatever
he dies of. Unexpectidely, he get's killed the very next day. Immediately he wakes up in the future, his mind now in a box. We follow Bobs experience learning how to control various functions of his box,
including how he manipulates his external environment through spider like robots of various sizes. It's such an immersive and surrieal experience the way the author describes it. It reminds me of how today's
LLMs are given access to tools and can interact with other systems. Considering this was written in 2016, well before the LLM driven AI hype train, this fact makes We Are Legion very special to me. After some
training he then get's launched into orbit, where he is put in charge of an intersteller self replicating space probe. A thrilling escape sequence takes place when he leaves Earth. And then the voyage begins.

This was one of the most creative books I've read this year. The plot is so interesting, it's not hard to follow along, it's not dense in the slightest, it's an easy read. But my god does the Dennis build one
of the most amazing stories ever. As a software developer, it constantly made me reflect on how I would go about applying my programming knowledge to the situations presented in the book. Needless to say I
finished this book in 3 days, then immediately lent it to my father who also enjoyes sci-fi. A few days later I picked up the paper back at my local library for the sequal, For We Are Many and plan to read it
in the new year (2026). If you are interested in programming, space, astronomy, love some witty humor, and funny VR fish companions, definitely pick up a copy.

### **Medicine Walk**




### **This Is How You Lose The Time War by Max Gladstone**

This book, as a read, is simply just beautiful. Funnily enough, I learned about it by watching some marketing youtube video, about a tweet that made the book go viral that simply told readers to read it, no
further detail. And I think in that same spirit of the tweet that got me to read it, I'll keep my review short as well.

This book is a beatifully written, sci-fi, time travel, poetic masterpiece. Definitely give this a read. It's a short book, very easy to read and follow, and has a very neat ending.

### **Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir**
Obviously I read this because of the upcoming movie staring Ryan Gossling, but my god was this a fun one.

The main character Ryland Grace, a school teacher and ex-molecular biologists, is shot into space to save our sun from space algea, refered to as Astrophage. The entire book is filled with fun and witty science
experiments, fun dialouge, and an interesting mystery that even get's added to throughout the book.

The ending was probably the best beat that I enjoyed the most. Even though this book clocks in at under 500 pages, it still captures your imagination and curiosity by drip feeding you a continously intergiuing
slurry of coma sludge filled mystery. I cannot wait to see the movie adaptation next year!
