When is the best time to Open Source?

When is the best time to take that private repo public? Does it matter if everything is working?


Open sourceing a project you've been working on for months is daunting. It means complete strangers are going to be to use and critique your code, your choices, and ultimately your intelligence. Sounds scary and anxiety inducing right?

Wrong, in reality, and I don't mean to shit on your project, but in the vast majority of cases, no one will care.

Why am I saying this? Because it makes it important to open source your porject immediately! If your intent is to gain an audience, a following, and grow a user base in your project. Open source early and often. It doesn't matter the quality of the code, or even if everything is fully functional and working. The idea with open sourcing before anything is ready is that you expose your idea to the internet, to google, to people just browsing around github, reddit, or dev.to.

People are too protective of their code. They think they are mastermind artists, and everything must be in it's place. It must be production ready before others lay their hands on my precious code `*hisses in smegol from lord of the rings and the hobbit*`.

The honest to god truth: no one cares, no one will even know your code will exist. When you go open source, the commit history of your git repo is etched in the stone that Linus torvold cut from the mountain itself. Unless your a massachist that is.
