Value(s) by Mark Carny: Book Review

# Description
Mark Carny proposes in his book Value(s) a new approach to solve our largest global problems. Are his arguments convincing? Or lack substance...



good reads review: 

This book is a politically motivated self inspired puff peace written to impress other neo-liberal technocrats. The analysis is sound but conclusions and solutions preposed are poorly argued.

Great analysis on how markets erode social and moral values, very poorly articulated solutions and conclusions based on very dense information that ignores non capitalist solutions to societal problems. His solutions shoehorn in markets as a final solution to all social woes, delegating government as a creator of frameworks and ethics, without regulation or an enforcement mechanism. He acknowledges that markets can’t be all knowing solutions, but then proceeds to pitch how markets can solve our problems with the right “framework”. He fundamentally ignores how a government can be used to create social programs, welfare systems, safety nets, universal healthcare, and successfully resolve societal issues. The values he pitches that can be resolved, in his view, by the market, are already in many cases being solved by the government, charities, local communities and cooperatives already.

His conclusions ignore the fundamental fact that markets main motivation is profit. Enforcing a framework of morals and ethics on a market, somehow without regulation, means reducing and changing the profits of that market. Which will always be met with resistance. Mark Carney fails to acknowledge this fundamental feature of market dynamics and how that affects the outcome that allows market value to supersede societal values. Especially in a the non regulatory approach he proposes.

Overall, great analysis of the system and the problems we face. The first few chapters and sections about how markets can erode society is well written. This rest of the book is a poorly written boring ramble directed at IMF, UN, and multinational corporation leaders.

His conclusions are poorly argued and vaguely gestured at, purposefully absent of alternative non capitalist solutions, and demeans the role governments have to play not just in regulating markets but building non market solutions to societal problems. Problems that governments around the world have already solved without a market solutions, with results far better than any hyper capitalist resolve.






list of points:
1. Carney's diagnoisis of todays three crisis in Value(s), credit, covid, and climate crisis are strong. But his solutions are weak and remain entirely within capitalism.
2. He avoids critquing capitalism itself, instead balming insufficiant regulation and poor framewokrs for market failures.
3. Misplaced Faith in Markets. Carney bleives the market can fix itself if given the right incentives, carbon pricing, esg standards, ethical frameworks, etc. This is flawed because markets are structurally incapable of prioratizing ethics or justice, especially when profit is at stake (eg, cancer drugs, fair wages, affordable housing). If there is money to be made by taking advantage of people who are disadvantaged and in horrible situations, the market will exploite that without government regulation and concenquneces.
4. Avoidance of Public Sector Successes. Carny ignores the success of pugblic programs like Canada's universal healthcare, which have saved lives, reduced inequality, and created propserity - more than any private company like Loblaws or shell or Rogers ever have. He downplays or omits crown corporations, public services, and social safety nets that already align with the values he advocates.
5. Lack of moral framing. Public goods (healthcare, housing education, welfare) are framed as tools for economic stabilitiiy not as inherent moral goods, he misses the moral argument that public services promote dignity, security, and equality regardless of market logic and regardless if a framework can convince a market to abide by those values or not.
6. Avoidance of Class and Power. Carny avoids discussing coprorate power, wealth concentration and class conflict. Without confronting who holds power his proposals merely tweak capitalism instead of transforming it.
7. ignores cooprateive models. Carney never mentions cooperatives or worker-owned enterprises as solutions, desprte their alignment with his stated values, fairness, sustainabilitiy, accountabilitiy. Co-ops offer ethica
 competitiveness and less exploitative structures, but he fails to acknowledge them.
8. Fails to address urgency. His slow, market-led vision ignores the time-sensitive reality of the climate and social crises we face. Regulating the samee acotrs that caused the problem is not asufficiant or timely strategy. You woudln't propose to the black community thate the racists police can fix the racists police problem if we provide a "framework". They need to face punishment and actual conciquences for their actions, they need actual regulation, which leads to actual accountabilitiy. And it needs to be persistant.

My vision.
Markets can be useful. Don't get me wrong, in new sectors, new technology, and non essential inovation. A healthy shackled and bounded system, not dominant, can provide us with the benifits of capitalism while limiting the exploitative nature of the market structure. Public systems must handle essentials like housing water power healthcare food transport internet. All should be garunteed by the state, not sold for profit. Feinforce what works: public health care, crown corps, unions, community entperprises, credit unions. Ultimarly we need to restrain capitalism. We need to limits it's abilitiy to exploit, not innovate.


My questions for Mark Carney:
1. Why doesn't Carney acknowledge the scucess of Canada's public healthcare system as a moral and economic triumph?
2. Why are cooperatives, which match his stated values, completely missing from his book?
3. Why does he belive that the market can be moralized when it actively resists morality and social responsibilitiy?
4. Isn’t his whole project hypocritical if it calls for aligning values with capitalism, while ignoring the systems that already do this better?
5. Is it naive to believe in reinforcing public systems and shackling capitalism instead of reforming it from within? (Short answer: No.)
6. Doesn't relying on market regulation without public ownership just empower the market further and weaken the democratic state?

All his argument remain within the capitalist system and don’t critique it at all.


He’s got great analysis of the situation, but his solution and approach is built on a faulty conclusion that markets can fix the problems we face if given the right incentives. It’s a capitalist solution within a capitalist system that avoids critiquing capitalism itself and instead blames the government for not regulating capitalism in the “right” ways, still allowing exploitation, denying the advantages that social programs already solve societal values and fix issues markets can’t resolve. 

Is my argument ignorant or too naive? Would a better solution be to build better social safety nets and coops and social programs? Re enforce what works, shackle capitalism to work for innovation and in a very limited scale? Capitalism fails flat on its ass when scaled to government sized power. It corrupts and will always push against and ignore our values. A weak government that allows a free market to exist without social safety nets will lead to a feedback loop where citizens rely on the market over the government and provide the market with unlimited power.

Even when he mentions government programs, it’s often in the language of de-risking private investment or maintaining economic stability, not as inherent goods. That’s the classic neoliberal framing:
	•	Welfare is there to stabilize labor markets.
	•	Health care keeps the workforce healthy.
	•	Education feeds innovation.

But what’s missing is the moral argument:

That public services and welfare are ends in themselves — not just tools to serve the market.

⸻

4. He avoids class politics

To acknowledge the role of public healthcare, housing, or transit as transformative public goods is to also acknowledge the failures of markets and the power imbalance of capitalism.
Carney doesn’t go there. He avoids naming class, corporate power, or wealth concentration as structural problems — because once you do, you can’t unsee them.





So he’s completely hypocritical here, talking about aligning human and societal values morals and ethics, forcing the market to bend to our will. But that won’t solve the problem of the market inherently can’t profit off of those morals. If they don’t profit off of a cancer drug they won’t make the cure??? Like that happens all the damn time. His argument breaks down here completely. His argument only works if you ignore the success story of the state and government programs and welfare and the actual benefits they provide. Markets alone will not give a shit if someone is dying in the cold on the street. 

Why does carney completely ignore the importance and the roll the government plays in welfare and social safety nets? Why does he not acknowledge that canadas health care system has saved millions of lives and promoted the prosperity of all Canadians far more than rogers, loblaws, or shell has ever done? Why does this not get acknowledged as a powefull solution to climate crisis and economic and social upheaval 

Like I don’t understand the argument against cooperatives and reinforcing that, they maintain that competitiveness in a market but give workers more ethical control over the company and create a system that is not imbalance of power. It’s less hierarchical and therefore inherently less exploitative. Why is this ignored as a general solution to fixing markets. 

I agree with him, markets are good in new industries and to push forward technological advancements, it’s how we can incorporate large amounts of humanity into creating a better world through shared collective competition. But basic human survival, power, water, health care, food, internet, things essential to modern life and well beaning, transport, these are things that should be managed by the government, through programs and wellfear programs and crown corporations 

The government has been the rule setter for decades and nothing has changed, the markets always push back, lobby, manipulate, and ignore laws if they are not constantly pressured to follow them. He completely ignores this fact. Crown corps, social welfare, wealth redistribution and tax reform are all fundamentally different solutions that tackle things a simple market cannot. We will not get living wages if a market is ethical, markets fundamentally push for the cheapest most profitable product, and labour cost will always be pressured downward.

His approach completely ignores this, ignores the urgency of climate crisis and economic and societal crisis. 

Does carney acknowledge or use the government in his plan at all in an effective way outside of just relegating it to market regulation and framework building?

I’m growing quite disappointed with carneys approach in his book values on just regulating and building a framework to let the market solve our problems, I feel like that approach still allows a fundamentally broken system, the market, to make decisions and try to fix things that the market itself fundamentally isn’t able to do. Regulation, government programs and initiatives and even crown corps in my opinion are the only way. Are there more ndp or socialist books on this topic that are a good balance to his book 


# Notes from book with page numbers and quotes:

## Expansion of the market is argued to be bad, but then actual government intervention dismissed?
> [...] whether the expansion of the market is charnging the underlying social contract on which it has been based. Has the emphasis on the individual over the community, our selfish traits over our altruistic ones, imperilled both the market's effectiveness in determining value and ultimately society's values?

- Value(s) page 113

he acknowldeges the markets actions many times:

> An essential point is that, just as any revolution eats its children, unchecked market fundamentalism devours the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of cpaitalism itself. All ideologies are prone to extremes, and capitalism loses its sense of moderation when the belif in the power of the market enters the realm of faith."
- Value(s) pages 120-121

He goes on to describe how this core idea of complete and utter faith in the market lead and heavily prepelled the 2008 financial crisis.


> [...] the spread of the market undermines community, which is one of the most important determinants of happiness. When we outsource civic virtues to paid third-party providers, we narrow the scope of society and encourage people to withdraw from it.
- Value(s) page 127
^ in this point he almost acknowledges and eludes to the fact that markets capitalising on social media are causing extremism and political biopolarism. People who withdraw from society are vulnerable to exploitation by grifters, red pillers and extermists in general. This is a deep acknolwedgment that markets can ruin and destroy lives and society if left unchecked. A good proof of this in real life: We are seeing a rise in male extremism in right wing manospherespaces. People withdrawl from society and are more exploitable without the social safety net of friends, family, neighbours, aquantences, third spaces, healthy mens spaces, libraries, clubs, movie theaters, social spaces, all of which have been exploited for market profits and their resulting 'social capital', as he puts it, diminished.

> Most of the market saw only a portion of what was going on. The vast majority assumed that someone else - the banks, the rating agencies, big investors, the owners of the SIVs, or the regulators who had trusted the wisdom of th emarket - had asked the right questions and done the hard work.
- Value(s) page 148

^ Isn't this not a reason for why the government should have been more strictly regulating markets in general? and more oversieght? Like in the first place? Markets unatended leave unasnwered questions, profit seeking, and dangerous risk taking.

> [...] the market undercuts community, atomises the family and affects mental health by turning more of life into a scorecard competition.
- Value(s) page 128

He then elludes to his solution and then expands upon it in a later chapter: 

> In my experiencce, the upheaval the world has been experienceing demonstrates that it is vital to rebalance the essential dynamism of capitalism with our borader social goals.
- Value(s) page 129


Never once does he acknowledge that this if a fundamental and well known conflict with capitalism: market pressures to extract profits always push against social values, ethics, and morals. There are more examples of this throughout history than there are examples of good, moral, and ethical capitalists. I mention this because he later points to an example of a caplitalst in the 1700s who was "good" to his workers, pages 341-> through section "How Purposeful Companies Create Value". Regardless of the policies, regardless of the framework and guidlines, capitalism will not lissen unlessed severaly punished and constrained. it will not abide by our values if it means it can extract value and money by violating them.


He later goes on to contradict his values > value logic within the same paragraph:

> Companies exist to improve our lives, expand our horizons and solve society's problems, both large and small. [...] But just as breathing is essential to living, profit is vital to the delivery of purpose over time.

- Value(s) page 340

Companies exist to create profit for investors and owners. That excess profit is created fundmanetally through exploitation. They create profit by exploitating societies problems. To expand on his profit to breathing analogy: Profit trumps morals and ethics, someone drowning will pull you down to stay alfloat.

Mark Carney is simply wrong about his conclusion that companies exist to improve our lives. The market is designed to create profit, companies that operate within that market structure therefore must seek profit to remain successful and competitive. That is a basic fact of market dynamics that is well understood and completely contradicts his logic.


He acknowledges the good governments can do in times of crisis and the role the state plays:
> Society's response to Covid has revealed much about people's relationship to the state and the values of society. Most fundamentally, when faced with catastrophe, governments and citizens drew on their core values and made decisions based on human compassion and not financial optimisation.
- Value(s) page 205

But then also faults the government for a lack of preparedness, preparedness that could very well have been solved in a society with more government safety nets, stronger healthcare, welfare, and market regulation:
> Despite their fundmanetal duty to protect their citizens, governments systematically undervalued resilience in the run-up to the Covid crisis.

Governments have been obsessed with markets, our societies focus on them and provide them will all the effort and capital needed to successfully accomplish anything. With an underfunded healthcare system, of course, the government wasn't able to prevent a fucking pandemic you twat. Maybe if it had adequate funding, if government programs were funded to achive that, then yeah we could have had a better response. he tries to use this point to argue that this lack of foresieight, is a good example of something that a market would solve if "frameworked" properly. But that ignores the fact that the reason we were underprepared is because markets were sucking up the capital needed to prepare our societaly values based system of heatlhcare in Canada.



This point really get's to me and needs to be used as a storng argument in the final draft:
> [...] the climate crisis is growing because, tin the tragedy of the commons, we are not pricing the externalities of pollution and we are effectively ignoring the environmental degredation and species loss, while in the tragedy of the horizon we are undervaluing the future, leaving a tragic legacy for future generations.
- Value(s) page 343

He is using this anaology of the tragedy of the commons and applying it to a global, monolithic market. The solutions to the tragedy of the commons are ignorantly being applied to a very complex, very large, and a completey different scale of issue. Solutions to problems don't scale when the size of the problem itself increases. the solutions to the tragedy of the commons, especially the community solution, works on that scale because a local community can communicate and control the resource together. In a global market, there are corporations, a market of competition. The same motives that each company has are very different than that of the motives of an individaul. (need to expand and harden this point with logic. it's too soft and weak but there is a good argument here.)




## the good capitalist with purpose argument

He uses this weird analogy of this old timey, very specific capitalist, Josiah Wedgwood, who created a potery company in the 1700s:

> Wedgwood implemented a sick club scheme at his factory, where eemployees paid a small portion of their weekly wages into a fund that could be used to support those who had to miss work due to ill health or accident.

- Value(s) page 342

He describes this as if it's a well purposed capitalist and presents it as an example of a good boy. What I see? I see a lack of a social support system being exploited by a capitalist to make his employees more dependent on him and his company. Companies did this all the time, company towns, company script, company stores. We banned and outlawed that because they couldn't be trusted to not use those systems to exploit their workers.

Mark Carney iterally describes a system of taxation for a service. Something that the government already does. It exists to faciliate tax collection and creation of social services. This has been done for hundreds of years successfully.

I need to find this but he makes another point later on that this is an example of a good capitlast. But he literally is providing a socialist service and system with extra capitalist inneficient steps.




## Other

> It took centuries to define and set up the appropriate constitutional relationship between the state and the church. The process was so long because politics and religion are linked and separeate at the same time and both aspire to capture that totality of the person. They must be kept apart because they have to do with fundamnetally different aspects of human experience - power and fiath - and when the two contaminate each othe, both deprave. Political and economic activity too are linked and separate at the same time. They too are corrupted by contamination, but need to relate to each other. Power and wealth are two fundamentally different categories, and yet each may determine the fate of the other. The present crisis is not only a powerful reminder that the relationship between markets and government is still largely unsettled, it is also an event that may disrupt economic prosperity and democratic freedoms.

- Value(s) pages 117-118
Mark Carney quotes a warning Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa gave shortly before his death. Later stating:

> And in the years since he spoke, the market has extended its scope and this mutual reliance has become dnagerously unbalanced. There has been a steady commodicication of assets and activities - putting them up for sale - including of our free time. [...] While this greater commodification has made our lives better in many cases, it has often weakened personal ties and undermined social and civic values. 

- Value(s) page 118

> Markets are not ends in themselves, but powerful means for prosperity and security for all. As such they need to retain the consent of society - a social license - to be allowed to operate, innovate and grow.
- Value(s) page 172.

Mark Carney here is acknolwedging that markets must operate within the social confinsed and acceptable values of a society. And implies that when they seriously violate and exploit those values, they should be punished and even revoked from their operations.

> So this time is no different. Markets don't always clear. And we can suffer from their amorality.
- Value(s) page 172

> To resist their siren calls, policymakers and market participants must bind themselves to the mast. That ultimately means recognising the limits of the markets and rediscovering our responsibilities for the system.
- Values(s) page 173

again, these last two quotes illustrate a willingness and eagerness that policymakers and regulators and the government should play a role in roping in and regulating markets.


- Need to articulate these two quotes better and their contradictions:

When discussing the three main solutions to the tragedy of the commons, taxation/pricing, privatisation, and community management, Mark Carney concludes:
> The third solution to the tragedy of the commons that has been documented by the Nobel economist Elinor Ostrom is for memebers of a community to cooperate or regulate to exploit scarce resources prudently. This is exactly what efforts by leading companies reginonal governments and countries are trying to achive - a political consensus that leads to shared management, and by doing so unleashes the private sector dynamism.

- Value(s) page 255

In the above quote he again contradicts himself. Earlier on page 254 he discusses the second solution to the tragedy of the commons, privatisation, and admits it's faults:

> While it was managed more sustainably [compared to pure commons], there were obvious wealth transfers and deep questions of equity in the assignment of ownership. If these decisions are hard at the local level, they are virutally impossible at the global level.
- Value(s) page 254
Why then does he propsose, within the third solution about community ownership that Elinor Ostrom argues for I would like to add, that we continue to marketize and capitalize on the tragedy of the global climate crisis commons: "[...] a political consensus that leads to shared management, and by doing so unleashes the private sector dynamism." "shared management" is implying community ownership, directly contracted by the statement "private sector dynammism.", you This entire point, that creating a community ownership over the global climate cannot function in a private dynamism. Those are two completely different systems.




Mark Carney concludes the chapter "The Climate Crisis" with the following conclusion:
> Finally we need financial markets to work alongside climate policies in order to maximise their impact. With the right foundations, the financial system can build a virtuous circle of better understanding of tomorrow's risks, better pricing for investors, better decisions by policymakers and a smoother transition to a lower-carbon economy.
- Value(s) page 263

I understand that capitalism and markets have a role to play in motiviating innovation and technological development, which is especially needed in the climate crisis. We do need new solutions. And I'm in agreement that market dynamism is able to play a role in that given the right incentives. But we must acknowledge the fact that markets got us into this mess, the markets that did need to be heavily regulated and scrutinized a lot more than they have been and are today. Carney wants the markets to work for us, great, then stop the oil and gas industry from polluting our planet, stop the big tech companies from harming our children and our mental health, stop the privitization of healthcare (a proven failure of capitalizing social values). Invest in green energy, invest in evs, in solar, in carbon capture (as innefective as it may be, that's what a market is there to discover though.), and all the other sections of the economy that are actually helping transition and heal our world. We cannot continue to fund and support a dying industry that is actively harming our world while calling for that same industry to help it. It cannot happen. It's a complete conflict of interest that cannot simply be resolved with the right "framework", "policy" or "guidlines" as Mark Carney suggests. It's a childish faith in the market.



> To be clear, while private actions have been part of the problem in the past (ignoring externalities and succumbing to the tragedies of the commons and the horizon), we won't solve climate change in the future without the private sector.
- Value(s) page 280

Mark is understating the role the private sector has played in the climate crisis. He is using this very soft language and analysis, while pointing to public and state problems that in comparison are much smaller in scope than a global catastrophy caused by private corporations. They are active problems, not "problem in the past". Active and continous to this very day.


Again Mark Carny displays more of the blind faith in the market that he argued against in the previous chapters:
> When society places emphasis on solving a problem, the private sector swings into action, coming up with solutions that public authorities could not have imagined, and implementing them with a speed and competitive zeal that continually surprises.
- Value(s) page 280

Is this always the case? What about when it goes beyond swinging into action? What about when it goes beyond profiting off of an innovation and into the territory of profiting off of exploiting the people whoe rely on that innovation? What then? Is it still the private sector swinging into action?
Another point: if there isn't an incentive to do so, to solve the problem that society is facing, if there is a reason not to do it, the private sector will not act. Companies jack up insulin prices in the United States because they are allowed to, in Canada we regulate that market so that our citizens are able to stay alive, because otherwise the market would push them to the brink to exploit them for everything they have.

Mark is minimizing the governments contributions to innovation only to regulation of markets and ignores the fact that the government actually innovates through various public projects. The manhaten project. The internet. Nasa, iss. There are a ton of very impactful government projects that have contributed to innovation outside of the private sector market. The private sector in many casas profits off of government public innovations.

I agree with this point, but his emphasis on private sector solutions, rather than a mix of state regulation, state solutions. Competly disregarding public solutions and public institionts and the role they can play in solving this problem. His moto is basically, "government, you do some setup, but stand asside and let the markets fix the problems they created":
> Fixing this collective-action problem is a shared responsibiliity acrossfinancial instituions and regulators.
- Value(s) page 285


Mark points to biofeuls and carbon capture as a way the markets can save us in the climate crisis, even they the science behind them are shaky at best:
> Another $50 to $135 billion per year will be needed to develop and scale carbon catpure and biofuel technology.
- Value(s) page 287

Mark Carney claims:
> As this book has made clear, I am not a market fundamentalist in that I do not refelxively think that the market is the answer to everything.
- Value(s) page 298

He certainly seems to shoehorn in the markets into almost every problem society faces in the modern day? He also diminishes the role governments and states can play in solving these problems. His approach is a market first solution, one that doesn't include regulation. Seems to me to be pretty market fundamentalist ideolgy if I'm not mistaken. Just waterdowned and white washed for the masses who crave more freedom.

> At the same time, I have seen the market's immense poiwer in multiple situations, and I know that the market is a critical part of the solutions to many of humanity's greatest challenges.
- Value(s) page 298

> I have seen day in and day out the very human desire to gorw and progress, people's yearning to make better lives for themselves and their families.
- Value(s) page 298

We aren't talking about people though? Companies abstract this stuff away. Markets abstract these drives into profit seeking, morally agnostic motives and profit. Not human desire to grow as a society.

Capitalism's goal is infinite growth in the constraints of a finite system. That will fail. It is starting to fail, and climate crisis is a symptom of this failure. There will be others.

> Continued growth isn't a fairy tale; it's necessity.
- Value(s) page 298

Mark Carney's suggestion is business as usual! Technology and markets can grow, new innovations. Thats fine. The problem is that these markets expect infinite returns, instead of a stable, self sustaining system. That is reasonable. Infinite growth is not, and it's straining our planet and the delecately balanced ecosystem that we depend on.

> The policies for a achieving our climate goals should be designed to encourage the economic adjustments and technological innovations at the least possible cost [cost to who? To the companies and the market? What about the people? What about the cost to society?], while sharing the burden of adjustment fairly [not just the market that got us into this mess! The citizens and government need to help bail us out!] within countries and across nations.
- Value(s) pages 298-299

# Important points

Mark carney suggests that bankers and business leaders should be emboldended with values:
> To move to a world that once again values the future, bankers need to see themselves as custodians of their institutions, improving them before passing them along to their successors.
- Value(s) page 345 (chapter: How purposeful Companies Create Value)


But fails to suggest any meaningful solution besides letting the bankers self regulate:
> Regulations, codes and compensation have their place, but ultimately integrity can neither be bought nor regulated. It must come from within; it must be grounded in values.
- Value(s) page 345


Instead, he points to instilling a vague sense of "prupose" in companies, again without including an enforcement mechanism:
> Without a sense of prupose, finance lost track of its core values of fairness, integrity, prudence and responsibility, which eroded the social licence on which the markets need to innovate and grow.
- Value(s) page 245

The prupose of companies and markets is to create capital. Profit. The market incentivises this above all else. Fairness, integrity, prudence and responsibility, get lost and abstracted away by the structure of the market. Mark Carney is pitching a magical fairy tale about how markets can self regulate if given a majestic sense of purpose. His point is not based on any action, not based on enforcement, just the expectation that maybe, just maybe, because societal values are profitable, that the market will act morally. But that is simply false, markets are designed to create profit, there is not built in mechanism to regulate and maintain a sense of prupose in a company. He proposes no solution to how this can be maintained and enforced that doesn't rely on trusting the market and companies themselves. Completly unrelaistic.

If not regulations then what? What will enforce these values? He has no answer to this. He argues that markets can be bent to our social values, bent to the will of society, force them to work for us. But offers no other solution then lax regulations, market stimulation, and bailouts. His language about societal values above market value is completely defeated by his own conclusions.


In other pages Mark Carney discusses and talks about how governments failed to pre-emptively act and prepare for the covid crisis. He proposed the markets as a solution. Then goes on to state:
> The Covid tragedy proves we cannot wish away systemic risks and that we need to invest upfront to avoid disaster down the road. [...] Resilience is now highly valued. Given the shift in economic and social drivers of value, it will be rare for a company's pre-crisis strategy to remain optimal.
- Value(s) page 344


He argues that markets and capital, unregulated markets and capital, remember "ultimately integrity can neither be bought nor regulated" (Value(s) page 345), can 
> [...] capital can launch a common approach for sustainable growth. For copmanies, that means focusing on measurement, resilience and responsibiliity to achieve their corporate prupose. For investors it means using this information to identify the leaders and laggards, and to invest money consistent with the values of their clients. And for governments, it means stepping in to turn these nice-to-haves into must-haves by implementing mandatory, comprehensive frameworks where appropriate.
- Value(s) pages 345-346
^ This quote is very powerful and shows his approach clear as day: don't regulate, government creates a framework. Doesn't even mentionenforcement or how the companies will abide by this framework. Are they just expected to follow it willingly? If there is no enforcement mecahnism, they will always seek the easiest way to profit, and if the framework the government just 'creates' doesn't have an enforcement mechansism then the framework will be ignored and innefective at solving the crisis in Values that Carney outlines.

He nievely belives that companies will abide by social values if given a prupose:
> Companies bring people together to act collectively, with their motives empowered and their ac tions coordinated by their companies' purpose.
- Value(s) page 358

This ignores how companies operate in market. The problem isn't the companies, it's the self reinforcing motives that investors, capitalists, and the market at large enforce on companies to disregard their values, and punish them if their social values violate profit. Really improtant point

# My proposal for constrained markets around innovation:
> Markets are not ends in themselves, but powerful means for propserity and security for all. As such they need to retain the consent of society - a social license - to be allowed to operate innovate and grow.
- Value(s) page 172



# Main points and arguments

1. Misplaced Faith in Markets (both acknowledges this, then proceeds to promote faith in markets, but with "frameworks")
2. The Role of Government vs. Markets (denies that regulations are necissary, deminishes actual government successes in solving crisis and societal values)
3. Ignorance of Non-Capitalist Solutions (completely dismissses government regulations, ignores government social programs and welfare, ignores alteranatives like cooperatives and unions even though they align with his values)
4. Avoidance of Class and Power Dynamics (completly ignores employees are disadvantaged, and almost barely acknowledges them)
5. Conclusion and moral implications (His analysis and understanding of the situation is sound, but he lacks real conlusions with solid arguments that expand beyond the flawed underlying logic of free market capitalism. The urgency needed to address the situations and crisis he discusses is far more immense then his long term solutions are able to account for. he lacks the perspective of urgency.
