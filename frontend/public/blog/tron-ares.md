Tron: Ares fucking rocks

# description
The movie is getting a lot of flack in the news. People criticizing it's plot, praising it's visuals. I honestly don't care. The movie was goergeous, the plot was purpusful.

As a software developer, you so rarely see accurate portrayals of your craft on the screen. "Breeching the fire wall", "intruder detected", "hacking the mainframe", and the infamous "I'm in!" when someone gains access to the opponents system. Tron: Ares has it all, but it no way detracts from the fun and joy of seeing the plot represented in a semi realistic way. Tron, the original movie, setup a digital world, The Grid, a representation of digital programs communicating, fighting, surviving and following directives. I think Tron: Ares captures this imaginitive inturpretation of computer systems perfectly. It says "here are the rules of this world, run with it".

What stood out to me were two things: The general premis of interacting with a program, much like how we interact with llms now adays, being reflected in the universe of Tron. And the visual effects. My god. I have never witnessed more beautiful pixels. Everything from the shiney sparkely renderings of Ares forming into creation, and falling to ash. This movie has one primary directive: Look fucking badass. And it executed this directive flawlessly. The sound track compliments this, scored by Nine Inch Nails, the incredible tracks to this movie make those visuals hit with even greater power.

I cannot express the excitement this movie brought out in me. As a programmer I had fun imagining how I would go about building my own Grid. What would it run on? Would I make it decentralized, open soruce? Of course. How could you build an llm that thinks for itself given the current constrictions of their reactive/stateless nature? "AI" as we currently know are fundamentally stateless in almost all instnaces. The only statful condition that an llms exists in is it's original training on it's data set. This training however is conducted on expensive gpus once over a period of time. Ok somewhat stateful right? Why Can't we make this process continuous? Tron: Ares got me thinking about this, there are scenes where we see this system take place. Dillengers grandson interacting with Ares through a chat box, statefully. However we see this break down when Ares breaks free, responses are not immediate, or don't happen at all.
