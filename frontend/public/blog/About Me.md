A history of who I am.

# 2011
Pre 2011 I don't really remember much, but I was always a curious kid. My parents can attest to the number of toys that I have disassembled and the wall sockets I have set ablaze. We lived in Gray Alder court in Waterloo Ontario, I was attending third grade at the time, and middle brother was just behind me. Caelin my youngest brother had been born, but was still a baby.

My mom was working as a quality assurance engineer at Chirstie digital, my father was building out his own financial planning business creating finanical and insurance plans for people in need of them. One of the key things my parents have stressed to me about this period of life is how tight money was. I have a vivid memory walking through the clothing section of a store asking my mom for something to buy, she got down to my eye level, and said with anguish and tears in her eyes "Torrin, we don't have any money." It kept my dad up at night, he had panic attacks about being able to pay for the mortgage on the house. They've told me stories about having to keep recipets for gifts from family members during the holidays and birthday season to exchange for diappers. During this time my mom started a fitness instructing business with a friend. Soon she became inspired, and my father along with her, by the entraprenure Richard Branson and his rise to wealth with his company Virgin Records. They loved the idea of an "everything company" that you can use to branch out into any industry you want to try. This planted the idea in them to start their own business, one that wouldn't be limited to a single industry.

My dad has studied geography at the university of (I think Toronto? Acutally probably York? need to ask), he dropped out to pursue an offer in the banking sector. He worked at TD Canad Trust for 10 years as a teller and a branch manager. My dads love of finance and helping people inspired him to pursue financial planning, he later found it to be a sales heavy job, where the majority of th emoney was made upselling people, which didn't sit well with him. My mom studied pure math at the Univeristiy of Waterloo, during her coops she had the chance to work at many startups and technology companies working on cutting edge (for the time) compilers and even a "file sharing" dot-com startup. This gave her an introduction to building and testing software as well as a taste for the startup and small business environment.

During this time my parents were also pretty dissulussioned with the Ontario education system and Canadian corporate life in general. They started learning about montesumery schools, different appraoches to raising kids, even hippy compounds (not the crazy ones though). Online blogging at the time was just begging to take of thanks to Blogger.com, and they were able to read all about the lifestyles of "digital nomads" people who would sell their belongings and live anywhere in the world, while being able to work online. In 2025 "digital nomad" may sound cringe, like a trend on Tiktok, but in 2011 was quite a novel and unheard of concept. Being able to work, travel, and raise kids all at the same time? Sure with some difficulty, but thanks to Blogger, look there were people doing exactly that! Living the dream! So they started to plan. My mom began putting together a business idea for a software testing firm that would be called "worX4you", and began to get a couple clients.

And one day these three ideas came crashing together into a single motive: "Why not just sell everything, travel the world, and start a business?" And in 2011 that's exactly what they did. I have memories of strangers coming through our house and buying up everything that wasn't nailed down, toys, books, the tv, furnature, even an Ikea rocking chair I remember being distrought over having to let go of. As kids, myself and my two youngest brothers, we had no idea what was going on, nor did we clue in or care about the larger motive behind this change. Then one day we were told the house was sold, a tent trailer was baught, and we all pilled into the Kia Sedona, and went to go pick it up. The begining of our journey wasn't smooth, the trailer itself needed modifications so that our mini van could tow it, and the company we baught it off of wasn't ready by the time they said. So we ended up sleeping in the car waiting. But soon enough, we were on the road, ready to see the world.

My parents asked school teachers if what they were doing was right, and when the described the plan the teachers agreed we would get a much better education seeing the world than if we had to stay in a classroom. We drove south, crossed the Canada/US border, and headed for Florida. My mom to this day tells me about the first time they stopped to contemplate what they had just done. Myself and my brothers, playing in the sand on a beach, while they have a nervous break down, completely unsure of what to do next. Three children to feed and raise, no home, just a
