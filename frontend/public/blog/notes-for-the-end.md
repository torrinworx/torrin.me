I will make my last commit.

I will capture my last photograph.

I will speak my last words to every person I encounter.

We often think about taking our last breath, but I find it more purposeful to think about the end of the acts we enjoy and find meaning in.

How many photographs do I have left to take? 19,102? Maybe just 423?

Death and endings come in many forms. 

What ends will I experience in my lifetime?

What will the journeys to those ends entail? 

I held my breath as I took this photo, just to steady the frame, my fingers numb with cold.

I hope to take many more before my end.
