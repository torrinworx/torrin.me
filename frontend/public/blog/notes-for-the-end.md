The day will come where I will commit my last commit.

The day will come when I capture my last photograph.

Every person I encounter, there will be a day I speak my last words to them.

We often think about taking our last breath, but I find it more purposeful to think about the end of the acts we enjoy and find meaning in.

How many pictures do I have left to take? 19,102? Maybe just 423?

Death and endings come in many forms. 

I find myself wondering what ends I will experience in my lifetime.

How meaningful the journey to those ends are, or will be.

Nourishment for the soul. I hope I experience enough of that before my end.
