In my dream I saw an indi movie at the princess cinema in Waterloo that was playing a few years back that was about politics and the O problem and what to call it and at the end it was like we never should have called it “the” problem and there was like a dice involved. It wasn't anything specific and was left vague to interpretation. It felt like it was something mor fundamental to politics and governance. There were talks about conservatives representing the Republic structure in a Greek style democracy and how their values were founded and how no matter what political system you design there will always be conservatives who fight against social progress in favor for hierarchies .

This is coming in fresh from a dream I was having so I might be making this all up. I remember seeing it with my ex and it was very vivid where parts of my memory were blended with the film.

It was so cuking creepy, the women in the film was sitting at a desk talking and she said to a room of people discussing things that it never should have been called "the" problem, everyone was trying to guess what it should have been, is it a problem, the problem, any problem at all. She was playing with a dice on the table that was red with the word The on one of the faces then she turned it with one finger and my dream ended it was all very surreal and creepy and I don't know what it could mean. Emphasis wasn't placed on what the name of the problem was but it seemed to be a more metephisical and deeply disturbing metephor for something deeper. The creepy part was just her saying "we never should have called it THE problem." Not emphasising the problem but the word "The" for some reason. I'm not sure what that could mean 


It feels like The is representative of there not being a singular problem and how we tend to simplify things, the dream was so beautiful, my ex and I was talking about Germany and France and how France very much enjoyed being freed at the end of WW1 but the German people suffered greatly after leading to WW2, it was some enhanced thing like that. And then the women on the screen started talking or maybe it was in a lecture and I was sitting in on it. I never understood that part. Someone was talking at the head of the theatre or lecture or class hall it felt like in a movie theatre. 

It connected this concept to my relationship with here, where everything else seemed fine. But the only problem was that she wanted to live in America because she was born there and said she feels nothing for her Canadian up bringing and friends. She longs for America and wants to live her future there. She had contradictory logic, saying she doesn't feel she has roots or family or friends here in Canada and that she wants to go to th states because of that. But contradictory she wouldn't have any of that there either, she would still be alone, just in another country paying different taxes.

I never understood the origins of this urge for her and how she led it to the end of our relationship, this was during the time where the US was discussing publicly about annexing Canada, my home, and making it the 51st state. And refering to our leader as a governor. 

It felt like the dream was saying "we never should have called it the problem" in our relationship and "we never should have called it the problem" in politics. Its a word THE that simplifies our understanding of a complex system both personal and political, small and large, the same idea, and how politics can bleed into a relationship, effect people's life choice and decisions and ruin something that was quite beautiful.

complexity and oversimplificatio I feel are the main themes, how we name things can reveal what we’re trying not to face. She brought this fact up that she loves the US and it's a big part of her identity and I asked her questions about it and told her I would never live there we talked about it but could feel a tension in the relationship over that fact. It felt like we were ignoring it and it was silent for so long, like we both said in our minds that that's The problem of our relationship. Then one night something happened to trigger it and we broke up over it. I can't picture living in the US, she can't picture living here.

God it was powerful I felt like I want to turn it into a short abstract story or something. 

If you call it the problem, you’re pretending it can be solved. We both silently called it the problem, a singular thing that would be solved, work itself out, ignoring how that changes where the relationship would go.
  
I want there to be to levels, the macro level of the story about the lecture where people are arguing about the problem, the the micro level where we are discussing our relationship in the theatre. I want the audio to blend back and forth, repeating the line about we never should have called it the problem, where after going back and forth between both scenes it collapses into the theatre.
  
I want the point of the film to be about how politics can kill something beautiful and small and personal. How yeah sure it was never meant to be but it got in the way of my life in ways I didn't want. I didn't want my country to be annexed, I don't want to fight a war for my fredom, I want to live a life with someone and raise kids. I don't want things to be unspoken or labeled as the problem in a relationship.
  
I like the idea of the two layers falling apart, I think the lecture hall should be more chaotic and argumentative but the relationship scene in the theatre should take place and be very quite and formal no arguing just a happy undertone in everyone's voice like small relationship romantic vibes. Discussing the problem, with imagery of the relationship flashing between monologues, I'd like that part to be mostly silent.
  
Is like it to take place in the winter at night in Canada, snow falling down. I have memories of taking pictures of her in the snow.
  
I don't know what the actual conversation or monologues or script the characters would follow would look like specifically but that's the arc I would want it to have.
  
I like pointing back to the dice whenever certainty is introduced. Ebbing and flowing, a state in the main character wanting to grasp at certainty in the solution to the problem, the women lecturing roles the dice again. Dismantling his certainty about the relationship.
  
Maybe he walks into a theatre with her, they are going to see the movie the problem, some movie or documentary about a political thing, unlike that idea. Gives a reason for there to be a lecture some kind.
  
  
The women on the screen is the one that says the problem line then the women the main character goes to see the movie with says it in some monologue and then that leads to the crash and realization that the relationship won't work out and it's best to end things.
  
How relationships can be complicated, how complex ideas and systems can effect and destroy the potential of a small and beautiful relationship that had meaning. I want scenes and emphasis on how the relationship was functional and worked and was good and how there were really only good times. Not just the cliche movie trops but actual examples of a good and healthy relationship

# The problem
Winter night in Canada, snow is falling, light from the street, leds, making the snow look pretty.

Minimal, quiet, wistful, long takes, puases, soft sound, the only music is to emphasis the emotional reconcilation at the end.

charaacters, no names, just "baby". no character names, just like there is no political branding:
main character: a man, ... 
the women: ...

Two story lines:
1. the movie the problem, a political lecture that takes place in a lecture hall. Scenes of this film would be shown both on screen in the theatre and in full screen as part of this story.
2. the relationship, we blend discussions in the theatre and commentary from the rest of the relationship. It's not clear if this is happening now, in a dream, in the past, or at all.

I like the idea of not saying the names of any politicians or parties, not drawing attention to specific branding, focusing on the ideas themselves and how they impact our personal lives and our relationship with other people.

General story beats:
1. introduce the relationship, show how it works, the good times, something later on we can connect to and tie together flashbacks with content from this scene and other content from other times in the relationship. establish the seeing of this film in a small indie cinema. establish that she introduced him to indie films. Light effectionate banter, but also realstic portrayals of a functional and healthy relationship.
2. travel and arrive at the theatre, somethings off, main character has pause standing outside the doors to the theatre, "are you alright?", "yeah, just feeling off". metaphore for feeling off, the main character is feeling off about the relationsihp, but doesn't know why yet, his theatre experience will help him reflect on that... while walking off the street into the theatre. some forshadowing about how we don't always know what's wrong in our relationships before they reveal themselves.
3. walk in, go to concesions stand. we agree on the main character getting the snacks, while she buys the tickets to keep things even. just pure natural cooperation, showing relationship functionality.  Light effectionate banter and realstic portrayals of a functional and healthy relationship continue.
4. walk into the theatre, and sit down in the seats, this is where we stop seeing other people. When we enter the theatre we enter a sort of dream. the characters get comfy, we show a close up of them eating popcorn and them talking about something. Her saying "don't worry, it'll be fun" in a cheerful playful innocent way. the only subjects are the fictional ones on screen and main character talking and the women, it's not even clear if she's real. 
5. Discussions begin in the lecture about the problem, something about economics, something about politics, those who want a republic system, how this result will always be that way in that design, etc. The screen fills the frame
the discussions were not initiated by the lecturer, but she interrupts and proposes, not lectures, but proposes for a discussion that we examine the name of the problem. Characters in the lecture audience react in subtle confusion. we glimps a character staring at the camera within the film from one of the studnets seats. We only see there face slightly for a split second, it's not clear if it is him or not, maybe we don't even draw any cinematic focus to it.
we cut back to the main characters face viewing the film, hes confused because it's him.
"what if, " she proposes. "... we never should have called it **the** problem" 
that echos and lingers for a bit. the scene get's blurry
She pulls a single dice from her pcket and places it on the table, not a pretencious (look at this important thing placing it on the table) film school beat, but a subtle placing it on the table (her action and motion of placing it on the table). We cut to a close up shot of the 1 side of the dice being placed on the table. at the cue of the sound of the dice getting set down we cut to the next scene

6. Cut back in time to an early first date with the women, we are discussing first date things, then she mentions and brings up facts or information that prelude to "the problem". how she loves america, how she just got back from a trip there, how everyone is so nice there like they are here but more friendly.  How she misses it already, etc. I say to her with a "fair enough", without any resentment, just letting fair be fair, not to move on but just acknowledging her perspective is valid to her. We end this segment, a close up shot of her face while shes drinking tea, looking into the camera as if it were our eyes across from her, she tilts her hed and smiles a soft smile and simply says "problem" very softly and sincearly, stating the word, not a question, not in a creepy or horror way, just something that needs to be said.

7. cut back to in frame of the film. Someone from the audience proposes, "Well we could rename it, that would change the way people perceive the problem. instead of it just being this abstract feely thing. [using the word feely while talking about politics, the emotions in it, and again trying to draw attention to the fact that something about this lecture is off] We could even name it after a concept most are already familiar with, it would ease there understanding. It's a complex thing to wrap your head around after all...". The women inturrupts: "My concern isn't with the name, Problem, my concern is with how we linguistically desribe it, and how that effects our understanding of Problem at all. It's not singular..." more echoy soft sound. 

8. another scene that shows in adition, furthuring complex nature of the problem, how I expressed to her how I could never see myself living in America, how I almost despise that country and a large part of it's ego driven marketing with american exceptionalism. I don't want to live in a place where everyone around me thinks we are the best in the world. This scene takes place in a more intimiete setting, but still early on in the relationship. It concludes with her saying "fair enough" and smiles a kind loving smile. none of this is argumentative, it's a simple discussion of ones perspectives, anger has no place in this story. the main character looks at her, and says at "problem" as if it happens at the end of his breath, very softly. Again not a question, just sating the word. [the idea here with them saying fair enough and problem is that they are both choosing to ignore major life differencees that are incompatible, they are saying the world problem within these back flashes as a way to identify points where there subconcious took note of these instances. We are now viewing them, in flash back, in a retrospective on the relationsship, as key points the main character can relate back to.]

9. We cut back to the lecturer in the film, the students ask the lectuerer to elaborate, maybe the discuss amongst themselves about something, one of the studnets raises their hand and says "I don't understand", the lectuere continues "sometimes the very words we use to talk about Problem..." some kind of dialogue to tie in the last scene, something that discusses in the lecture scene, how we ignore the complexity of problems unconciously, and even their nature by the way we desrbie them. THE problem invoking a singular solution. When in fact there isn't a solution or problem at all. There is nothing to solve. "...hides what the solution is, or even if there is a solution at all." end this scene on that line.

10. a cut to the night things boil over for the main character and the women. Not in a traditional argument fight sense, but just the moment of realization that "there is a problem here". in terms of we have both identified something we cannot compromise on, something we can't change. Not that we have realized there isn't a problem yet, not that we have realized that there isn't a solution, just a night where we realize something is up. The scene takes place while we are both laying in bed, a discussion after sex, to show and establish the couples intimecy, the scene is just an overhead shot of us looking up at the camera above the bed, we re-iterate the points that were stated in the last two flash backs, like we are two people singing lines in a song back and fourth to each other. "I just don't ever see myself living in that country, that country has killed people in my family, they bombed Serbia", she says "Well I see my future there, that's the only place I feel at home or loved.

with a tone of "well then" we both say in sync "problem", we look over at each other, the camera moving in closer to our faces as we look into each others eyes with neutral calm expressions.

11. The main character is now the only student in the lecture hall showing his unified understanding, the previous multiple students were different ideas, the main character overthinking. The women, now the lecturer, it's made clear now that she is the women as it would have been obfuscated before. They look at each other, talking as if they were just discussing a concept as equals. [before the audience was only men, she was lecturing to them, as to show that the main character is learning this whole lesson from here]. "So there was never a problem in the first place", "correct" she injects,"because if you call it Them Problem, you're pretending it can be solved." "and therefore there isn't a solution" the main character continues. "It appears so" she says with a tone that she herself has realized this. rappid cut between two shots of them both saying "Well then" synced audio in unisin. 

final scene:
after the realization. The main characcter walks out of the theatre alone, bundled up, he looks around. He takes something out of his left hand pocket, the camera is still in the same place, we don't change perspective, but you can see it's the dice from the movie, he continues his happy smiling expression while looking at the dice, then places it back in his left pocket. you can tell he's happy, not upset or depressed. The camera is framed with him to the left and the doors to the theatre enterance behind him, We think he is alone and he has already broken up with the women in the theatre. But she comes out, also happy and blissfull, putting her hat on. she wraps her arm around his left arm. symbolizing she also has the dice. He says "Are you alright?", she replies "Yeah, couldn't find my hat", recalling the first scene where the main character was feeling off, meaning she couldn't herself find why this relationship wouldn't work out, but she found it for herself, meaning that she also came to the same realization as the main character that this relationship wouldn't work out, and that that's ok. the feeling at the end is, calm, sad but happy, it's ok, there was never a problem, never a solution that needed solutioning in the first place. They both smile at each other for a moment, then walk off screen.


Notes:
- the realisticness of going to see a movie about a lecture doesn't really matter, we don't even have to call it that. The point is that someone is dictating in a class room, (the women), about the problem (in the relationship), to the audience (the main character). And how that problem, while not a singular "the" in the sense that it is more complicated and deeply woven with who the women is, how it's doesn't have a singular solution. how silently or subconciously identifying the problem has two flaws: the person in the relationship ignores it subconciously hopeful things will work themselves out but has a lingering feeling of doubt, and how we subconciously identify it as a problem to be solved, a burden to take on. When in reality it isn't something we can solve and the main character needs to learn to let go of the relationship. How looking at what the main characters small micro scale personal life, was effected by this larger more complex system (political system, her views and ideologies, and how that impacted and changed the relationship and lead to it's end). concepts of how the larger scoped story about politics conflicts with what's important in life, the smaller things you actually get to experience in life. I want the story to be about: in the grand scheme of things, the grand schemes don't matter, it's what you actually experience in life, how the grand schemes can creep their ways into personal and beautiful things and ruin them.

in one of the earlier scenes emphasis needs to be drawn to her hat somehow. 

I want the story to be about letting go, not necissarily about resolving the relationship, but the longing for the beautiful thing that it was. how it's ok to mourn that it ended. Idk actually how it should resolve. Maybe it should just be left as a question.

want to find a way to weave the dice into flash backs somehow whenever certainty about something happens
