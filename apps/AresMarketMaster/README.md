# AresMarketMaster

## Overview

AresMarketMaster is an intelligent stock market analysis bot that leverages the power of LangChain and Hugging Face AI models. This bot operates on a 24/7 basis, constantly analyzing the latest news, company reports, financial reports, and other publicly available information for impacts on the stock market. It uses the insights gleaned from these sources to manage a virtual portfolio, buying, selling, or holding stocks as dictated by the state of the market.

- **Artificial Condition Testing:** AresMarketMaster includes a testing environment for running experiments and observing how the bot would react under specific artificial conditions.

## Getting Started

More detailed information on how to get started with AresMarketMaster will be provided as the project progresses.

## Limitations and Considerations

This is a complex project that involves many intricate components, including setting up Hugging Face models, customizing the PuppeteerWebBaseLoader, and designing the AI's decision-making logic for stock selection based on news sentiment analysis. These elements would need further research and development.

Moreover, while we aim to test AresMarketMaster under artificial conditions, it's important to consider the ethical implications and potential misuse of feeding artificial information to the bot. Please use this feature responsibly.

## Stay Tuned

As we continue to develop AresMarketMaster, we'll keep this readme updated with the latest developments and information.
