OrbKingdom is an immersive online multiplayer game that thrusts you into a mesmerizing, dark-themed microscopic world teeming with vibrant viruses, cells, and dots. Take on the role of a living cell, and navigate your way through the expansive map, absorbing smaller cells and evading predators.

This folder contains the code that is loaded onto the Nakama server via the `Nakama-dev.docker-compose.yml` file. This folder must first be somehow mounted onto the docker container, in the proper directory inside Nakama so it can read the folder locally I think.

In the future we should create a docker container that loads Nakama and torrinleonard.com or OrbKingdom if I ever make it a separate repo.
